Little script to upload statics to a S3 bucket by using official Amazon SDK.

## AWS Credentials

In order to use this module, you'll need to have AWS Credentials. You can load them, two ways:

* By passing directly to the method as second parameter.
* By having a ENV variable with the path to a file with the credentials.
  The ENV variable is `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PATH` and it should have `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, `region` and `bucket`.

## Install

```bash
npm install s3-folder-upload -S
```

In case you want to use the CLI, you can install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g s3-folder-upload
```

## Require
```javascript
const s3FolderUpload = require('s3-folder-upload')
// ES6: import s3UploadFolder from 's3-folder-upload'

const directoryName = 'statics'
// I strongly recommend to save your credentials on a JSON or ENV variables
const credentials = {
  "accessKeyId": "<Your Access Key Id>",
  "secretAccessKey": "<Your Secret Access Key>",
  "region": "<Your Aimed Region>",
  "bucket": "<Your Bucket Name>"
}

s3FolderUpload(directoryName, credentials)
```

## CLI
```bash
s3-folder-upload <folder>

Example:
s3-folder-upload statics
```

For the AWS Credentials you need a ENV variable called `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PATH` with the path of the file with the needed info.

## Wish list

- [x] Upload a entire folder to S3 instead file
- [x] Async upload of files to improve time
- [x] Detect automatically the content type of (limited support)
- [x] Return the list of files uploaded with the final URL
- [ ] Better support for parameters with the CLI
- [ ] Improve content type function in order to get more and better types of files
- [ ] Avoid to re-upload files if they didn't change
- [ ] Check if cache is blocking updates of statics on website.
